# READ THIS
I'd recommend steering away from trying to host this yourselves, the documentation is a complete mess and it isn't worth your time going around configuring every individual file to make it run properly. I will completely overhaul this project later, making it easier to setup and making it more dynamic. The project as of right now is **really messy**

# About this project
I made this project as an end of year project for my AP Computer Science A class. I will come back to this project to fix up some things, as well as add better documentation.

## Missing folders?

- You need to have a folder named ```bios``` that contains the console bios
- You need to have a folder named ```roms``` that contain the roms to the games

## games.json

this is where the sidebar gets its elements from.
to add a game to the sidebar, add a name and a file to games.json

## About PRs

PRs are not welcomed, you're welcome to use the project though!
