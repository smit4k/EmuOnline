# About this project
I made this project as an end of year project for my AP Computer Science A class. I will come back to this project to fix up some things, as well as add better documentation.

## Missing folders?

- You need to have a folder named ```bios``` that contains the console bios
- You need to have a folder named ```roms``` that contain the roms to the games

## Sample Documentation is in pokemoncrystal.html WILL FIX LATER

## games.json

this is where the sidebar gets its elements from.
to add a game to the sidebar, add a name and a file to games.json

## About PRs

PRs are not welcomed, you're welcome to use the project though!

## Broken?
Don't worry, I will update the documentation because yes, I know it's terrible documentation right now, but I will fix it and I will clean up the folder configuration.
