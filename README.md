# About this project
I originally made this project as a passion project and when my Computer Science course had us work on a programming project, I shifted more of my attention to this project and added more features (like DS support)! I may come back to this project later to fix up some things, but it is unlikely.

## Missing folders?

- You need to have a folder named ```bios``` that contains the console bios
- You need to have a folder named ```roms``` that contain the roms to the games

## Sample Documentation is in pokemoncrystal.html

## games.json

this is where the sidebar gets its elements from.
to add a game to the sidebar, add a name and a file to games.json

## About PRs

PRs are not welcomed, you're welcome to use the project though!
